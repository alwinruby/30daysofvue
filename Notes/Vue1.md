# Vue

**What is Vue?**

Vue is an open source JavaScript framework geared towards building user
interfaces, created by Evan You.

Vue is said to be the progressive JavaScript framework
that is approachable, versatile, and performant.

### Progressive

Vue is recognised to be __progressive__ since it can often be scaled down as
well as it scales up.

### Approachable

Vue is understood to be approachable since as long as you know standard
HTML, CSS, and JS

### Versatile

The Vue framework is recognised to be versatile since the Vue library itself fits neatly within an ecosystem of tools that make up the entire Vue framework. These tools are the:

The vue-cli <https://cli.vuejs.org/> (i.e. Vue Command Line Interface) which allows for rapid prototyping and set-up of Vue-Webpack applications.

vue-router <https://router.vuejs.org/> which helps us introduce client
side routing into our application with relative ease.

vuex <https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/> , the Elm-inspired Flux-like
library that helps facilitate how data is managed in an application.

vue-test-utils <https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/> , the testing utility
library that introduces various helpers and function to make testing Vue components a lot easier.


Each of the above tools was created and is currently maintained by the Vue
core team. This makes integrating and using them in Vue applications a
relatively seamless experience.


### Performant

Finally, Vue is seen to be performant since it takes advantage of the virtual DOM for incredibly fast re-render times. The Vue core library is also built to require minimal effort towards performance optimisation.

application needs to depend on an HTML DOM element to
control how the element behaves.__
