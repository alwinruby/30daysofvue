# The Vue Instance - Data

The Vue instance is the starting point of Vue applications and contains a data property that allows us to bind data from our instance and on to the template.

Instead of using methods, we could also write our intended functionality change inline in the template.

A Vue directive is essentially a special type of command that
can be added to HTML content.
